# NIM---A-Game-of-Strategy
The game Nim is a strategical game, whereby two players take turns in Nimming (removing) arbitrary
objects from one (or more) distinct pile(s). Each player takes a turn to remove at least one (or often
more) object(s) from one pile at a time. The maximum number of objects removable per turn is decided
at the beginning of the game. This number is known as an upper limit. Depending on the version being
played, the goal of Nim is either to avoid taking the last object or to take the last object. Nim is always
a two-player game but can be played with a myriad of varying rules.

The rules for this game variant will be as follows:

• The game begins with n number of objects placed in one pile (e.g. stones placed on a table).

• Each player takes turns removing one or more objects from the pile.

• The maximum number of objects a given player can take is limited by an upper bound; k. For
example, if this upper bound is k = 3, a player must remove 1, 2 or 3 objects from the pile on each
turn.

• The game ends when there are no more stones remaining; n = 0.

• The player who removes the last stone, loses. The other player is, of course, the winner.

• The initial number of stones (n) and the upper bound (k) can be changed from game to game and
are chosen before each game commences.
